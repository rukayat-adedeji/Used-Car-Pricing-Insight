# Used Car Market Exploration

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a used car prices dataset. The goal of this analysis is to derive actionable insights into car pricing trends and prepare the data for machine learning model training.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 54,273 rows and 13 columns with various features related to used cars, such as:
- **Brand**
- **Model**
- **Model Year**
- **Mileage**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Exterior Color**
- **Interior Color**
- **Accident History**
- **Price**
- **Horsepower**
- **Displacement**
- **Cylinders**

## Key Achievements
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and transformed features to ensure data quality.
- **Visualization:** Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover key relationships between car features and pricing.
- **Insights:** Derived actionable insights into car price distributions, brand impact on pricing, and identified key features that influence car prices.
- **Documentation:** Documented the entire EDA process, including visualizations and statistical analyses.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Conclusion
This EDA project provides valuable insights into the used car market, offering a foundation for further machine learning tasks, such as price prediction and car valuation.

## Future Work
- **Modeling:** Develop predictive models using this cleaned dataset to forecast car prices.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
